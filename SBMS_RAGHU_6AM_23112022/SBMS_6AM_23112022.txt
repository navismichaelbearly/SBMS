			Chapter#1 Spring Core

Dependency : Variable(Field) exist in class(Spring Bean)
Injection  : provide Data to variable (after creating object/while creating object)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Spring Bean : It is class that follows rules given by Spring container

a. class must be public type
b. recomanded to keep in a package (basePackage Rule)
c. Fields(Variables) are optional, if required recomanded to keep private
d. If variables present in class, 
     define default constructor with setters/getters
     (or/and) Parameterized constrcutor.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
e. We can override Object(C) methods :
   toString()
   equals() and hashCode().
[as they are non-private, non-final and non-static]

f. Inheritance Rule:
   Only Spring API is allowed (ie Spring F/w classes and interfaces)
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/

Ex: Servlets, EJB, JPA..etc are not allowed for inheritance.

g. Annotations Rule:
 Only we can add Spring API Annotation and Integration API Annotations
 (Hibernate with JPA, Restful webservices annotations)

Q) Can we define a class as private or protected?
A) Yes, but only inner classes. Not outer classes.
  Regular/Outer class can be only public/default.

Q) What is the super class for every java class?
A) java.lang.Object(C)

Q) What is abstract method?
A) A method has no Body and declared with abstract keyword.
 There can be a method delcared with native having no body
 ie implemented in Native Language(C-Language).


Q) Can we override a method of type final/private/static ?
A) No. It is not possible.

Q) What is the contract between equals() and hashCode()?
Hint: hashing, compare bucket, id, index...etc


Q) What is annotation?
A) Annotation is a tag added to Java code [Java 1.5]
  It is a metadata that gives information to Compiler/VM/Container/Server.
  todo some extra work.
  like Object creation, check syntax, call methods..etc

  Annotation ---> Compile --> interface
  Enum -------> Compile ---> class
