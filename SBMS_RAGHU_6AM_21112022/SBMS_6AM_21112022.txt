	------------------------------------------------------------
=> 3 types of application
1. Web Application
2.*** Distributed Applications ( An application that runs at Multiple Devices)
	/ Fullstack Applications
	/ Integration Applications
3. Microservices Application
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Web Application : Collection of Web pages run unders webserver.

 1 Application = n Services | 1 Project     = n Modules
Ex: Gmail Application
 User(Register and Login), Inbox, Sent, Drfats, Settings, ..etc
    Amazon Application
 User(Register and Login), Search, Cart, Payment...etc

*) Implementation of service/module: 
	This is implementation using Layers Design.
	Here we have 3 layers,
	1. DAL : Data Access Layer (Database Operations)
	2. SL  : Service Layer ( Calculation/Operations/Tx Management)
	3. PL  : Presentation Layer (View/Dynamic Web Pages/MVC).

ex: 
 calFd(){} //SL
 fetchOneRowById(){} // DAL
 showRegForm(){} // PL

==Example Distributed Application ==
*) An application that runs at multiple devices is called as distributed
  application.

Example: XYZ Bank Application
=> Frontend Application + Backend Application + Database Server.

This application can be accessed in different ways. Examples:
1. Manual Process
2. NetBaking (Web App)
3. Mobile Banking (Mobile App)
4. IVR 
5. ATM / DC 
6. 3rd Party Apps(GPay)
..etc

*) But here business logics exist at backend application.
*) Frontend applications are implemented using Angular, Android,..etc

*) Apps connected using HTTP Protocol using Global Data Format(JSON/XML).

=====================================================================
Webservices: Integration of multiple (at least two) applications
 which runs on different servers and implemented using different 
 languages (Java, .Net, PHP, Python..etc)

=> Here both applications are linked using IL (Integration Layer)
Using HTTP protocol and JSON/XML as Data Formats.
