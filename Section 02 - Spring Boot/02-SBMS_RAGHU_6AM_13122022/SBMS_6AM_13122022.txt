			Spring Boot Introduction

*) Spring Boot is a Spring based project that provides AutoConfigurations
  [Reduces common code written in Spring F/w]

*) Spring Boot has provided starters (Pre-Defined Jars for every concept)
ex:
	spring-boot-starter-jdbc
	spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
	spring-boot-starter-web
	spring-boot-starter-security
	spring-boot-starter-mail
	..etc

*) Spring Boot applications must connect with Parent Project.
   Our Project is known as Child Project.

*) We can create Spring Boot application either using Maven or using Gradle.
-> Project/Folder system is created
-> Dependency Management(JARs)
-> Links/Properties (Link with Parent Project/ Java Version Properties)
-> Goals/task (Compile, Build, Deploy..etc)

*) If we use Maven Project there will be pom.xml
    for Gradle build.gradle files exist.

*****) Spring Boot do not support XML Configuration.
   We need to work on Java and Annotation Configuration.

  XML is slow compared to Java/Annotation**

*) Spring boot has provided Embedded Webservers
   [Apache Tomcat(default), Eclipse Jetty, JBoss Undertow]
   to run our application (NO DOWNLOAD + NO INSTALL)

*) Spring boot has provided Embeeded Database [H2, HyperSQL, Derby]
   These are also called as In-Memory Database.(NO DOWNLOAD + NO INSTALL)
   Recomanded to use Dev/Test Environment. Not in Production.

*) Spring boot has provided support to work with External Servers
   and databases too.

========================================================================
		    https://start.spring.io/
		      Spring Initializr

*) This Website provides support to create Spring Boot application.
*) Even if we use Any IDE(Eclipse, STS, VSCode, IntelliJIDea)
   that should be finally connected to Spring Initializr

*) It has 5 sections
1. Build Tool (Maven/Gradle)
2. Programming Language (Java)
3. Spring Boot Version (3.0 / 2.7.x)
4. Project Metadata
   GroupId   : OrgName (com.oracle)
   ArtifactId: ProjectName 
   Version   : 6.1.2
   
   Package name: basePackage (All your classes must be under given
   				package or its sub-package)

5. Dependencies (JARs/Starters) : select Required Startes from Here

>> Finally click on Generate button >> Project is downloaded as ZIP
>> Extract to a Folder

========================================================================
JDK : 17/11
https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#java17

*) STS : Spring Tool Suite (using Eclipse)
Download Link: https://spring.io/tools
>> Downloaded as a JAR File
>> Double click to Extract
>> Open Folder and Choose SpringToolSuite4
>> provide one workspace (Folder name to store Projects)

>> Create one Project
 > File > New > Spring Starter Project > Enter details > next
 > Finish > Just check Folder System.
=======================================================================
Package : JAR, WAR and EAR

JAR : Java Archive (Standalone apps)
WAR : Web Archive (Web Applications)
EAR : Enterprise Archive (EJBs)  ==> WAR + EJB code
